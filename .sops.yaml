# This is a configuration file for mozilla/sops, a CLI for encrypting/decrypting
# content. See https://github.com/mozilla/sops.

# This is a file that configures SOPS to assume it should use a specific keyring
# and key if encrypting a new file. If it is to decrypt an existing file, that
# information will be available as metadata and this is not needed.
#
# To authenticate yourself sufficiently:
#
#   GCP:
#     gcloud auth login
#     gcloud auth application-default login
#
#   AWS:
#     ???
#
# To setup a new keyring and key:
#
#   GCP:
#     gcloud kms keyrings create l2l --location global
#     gcloud kms keyrings list --location global
#     gcloud kms keys create main --location global --keyring l2l --purpose encryption
#     gcloud kms keys list --location global --keyring l2l
#
#   AWS:
#     ???
#
# To encrypt a new file:
#
#   sops --encrypt --in-place deployments/l2l/secrets/common.yaml
#
# To edit an encrypted file:
#
#   sops deployments/l2l/secrets/common.yaml
#
